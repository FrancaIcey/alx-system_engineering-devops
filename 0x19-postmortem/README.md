Issue Summary

Duration: Approximately 4 hours (12:00 PM - 4:00 PM UTC), felt longer than a Monday morning meeting.
Impact:
Frontend service went on a coffee break, resulting in a 25% drop in user engagement.
Users experienced slower page loads than a sloth in a marathon.

Root Cause: Database connection pool exhaustion – turns out, our database connections were having a pool party, but no one invited the lifeguard.

Timeline

12:00 PM: Mysterious whispers of discontent echoed through the server room, detected by our vigilant monitoring system.
12:15 PM: Automated alerts hit the inbox like a surprise cake in the face at a birthday party.
12:30 PM: Initial investigation focused on frontend servers, suspecting they were on strike due to too many requests – who knew servers had labor unions?
1:00 PM: Unleashed the security team, suspecting a DDoS attack – turns out, it was just our servers doing the electric slide.
1:30 PM: Escalated to the database team after finding abnormal queries – databases apparently don’t appreciate impromptu dance-offs.
2:00 PM: Root cause identified – our database connections were sipping piña coladas while our frontend desperately needed their attention.
2:30 PM: Quick fix applied by giving our database connections a caffeine boost (increased connection limits) – nothing like a shot of espresso to kickstart those connections.
4:00 PM: Issue resolved; database connections reluctantly returned from their extended coffee break.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
Misconfigured database connection pool – our database connections were feeling too cozy, like trying to fit an elephant into a Smart car.
